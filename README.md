# Bayonetta Fan-Made Web Design Project

I've wanted to build this web design around one of my favorite video game characters for fun. As of now, I only wanted to achieve this index page where you can navigate between each of the main trilogy titles.


## Features
- Hovering effects on each Bayonetta render
- Hidden Bayonetta title logos which will only appear when hovering over their respective render images
